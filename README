= time_diff
Gem which calculates the difference between two time

== Installation

    gem install time_diff

== Usage

    require 'time_diff'

    time_diff_components = Time.diff(start_date_time, end_date_time)

This will return the hash of time difference in terms of years, month, week, day, hour, minute and second.

You can use the difference like:

    time_diff_components[:year], time_diff_components[:month], time_diff_components[:week]

== Formatted Time difference

    %y - year

    %M - month

    %w - week

    %d - day

    %H - hour

    %N - minute

    %S - second

    %h - hour (without adding 'hour' text to the hours. eg: 3 for 3 hours)

    %m - minute (without adding 'minute' text)

    %s - second (without adding 'second' text)

By default the format is 

    '%y, %M, %w, %d and %h:%m:%s' 

this will return 

    '1 year, 2 months, 3 weeks, 4 days and 12:05:52'.

You will get the result from the output hash, time_diff_components[:diff] 

You can pass your own format as third parameter to this function.

If you give '%d %h' as the third parameter to the Time.diff() method, then the difference(time_diff_components[:diff]) will be calculated only in days and hours.
