Install time-diff using:

gem install time_diff

It does monkey patch to the Time class. So to calculate the time difference you can use:

diff = Time.diff(start_date_time, end_date_time)

This will return the hash of time difference in terms of years, month, week, day, hour, minute and second.

You can use the difference like:

diff[:year], diff[:month], diff[:week]
