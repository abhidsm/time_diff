gem install time_diff

Usage
-----

require 'time_diff'

diff = Time.diff(start_date_time, end_date_time)

This will return the hash of time difference in terms of years, month, week, day, hour, minute and second.

You can use the difference like:

diff[:year], diff[:month], diff[:week]


Formatted Time difference
-------------------------

%y - year
%M - month
%w - week
%d - day
%h - hour
%m - minute
%s - second

By default the format is '%y, %M, %w, %d and %h:%m:%s' this will return '1 year, 2 months, 3 weeks, 4 days and 12:05:52'.
You will get the result from the output hash, time_diff_components[:diff] 

You can pass your own format as third parameter to this function.
