= time_diff
Gem which calculates the difference between two time

== Installation

    gem install time_diff

== Usage

    require 'time_diff'

    time_diff_components = Time.diff(start_date_time, end_date_time)

This will return the hash of time difference in terms of years, month, week, day, hour, minute and second.

You can use the difference like:

    time_diff_components[:year], time_diff_components[:month], time_diff_components[:week]

== Formatted Time difference

    %y - year

    %M - month

    %w - week

    %d - day

    %H - hour

    %N - minute

    %S - second

    %h - hour (without adding 'hour' text to the hours. eg: 3 for 3 hours)

    %m - minute (without adding 'minute' text)

    %s - second (without adding 'second' text)

By default the format is 

    '%y, %M, %w, %d and %h:%m:%s' 

this will return 

    '1 year, 2 months, 3 weeks, 4 days and 12:05:52'.

You will get the result from the output hash, time_diff_components[:diff] 

You can pass your own format as third parameter to this function.

If you give '%d %h' as the third parameter to the Time.diff() method, then the difference(time_diff_components[:diff]) will be calculated only in days and hours.

== Examples

    > Time.diff(Time.parse('2011-03-06'), Time.parse('2011-03-07'))
    => {:year => 0, :month => 0, :week => 0, :day => 1, :hour => 0, :minute => 0, :second => 0, :diff => '1 day and 00:00:00'}
    > Time.diff(Time.parse('2010-03-06 12:30:00'), Time.parse('2011-03-07 12:30:30'), '%y, %d and %h:%m:%s')
    => {:year => 1, :month => 0, :week => 0, :day => 0, :hour => 18, :minute => 0, :second => 30, :diff => '1 year and 18:00:30'}
    > Time.diff(Time.parse('2011-03-06 12:30:00'), Time.parse('2011-03-07 12:30:30'), '%H %N %S')
    => {:year => 0, :month => 0, :week => 0, :day => 1, :hour => 0, :minute => 0, :second => 30, :diff => '24 hours 0 minute 30 seconds'} 

== i18n support

   Add locales for day, days, week, weeks, year, hour, hours, minute, minutes, second, and seconds in your YAML file. For eg:

   en:
     day: divasam
     days: divasangal
